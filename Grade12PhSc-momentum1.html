        <h2 class="bold">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the quantity of motion an object possesses.
            It's a crucial concept for understanding interactions between objects, especially in collisions and
            explosions. This chapter will explore the concept of linear momentum, its relationship with force, and
            the important principle of conservation of momentum.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Momentum?</h2>
        <p class="definition">Momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity.</p>
        Mathematically, it is expressed as: p = mv Where: p represents momentum m represents mass (measured in
        kilograms, kg) v represents velocity (measured in metres per second, m/s)
        <p>
            It's important to remember that momentum is a vector quantity. This means it has both magnitude and
            direction. The direction of the momentum vector is the same as the direction of the velocity. The SI
            unit for momentum is kg⋅m/s.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bold">Examples of Momentum</h3>
        A fast-moving car has a large momentum due to its high velocity. A heavy truck moving slowly can have a
        large momentum due to its large mass. A small bullet, despite its small mass, can have a significant
        momentum due to its high velocity.
        <h3 class="bold">Momentum and Inertia</h3>
        While related, momentum and inertia are different concepts. Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist
        changes in its state of motion. Momentum, on the other hand, is the measure of the object's motion. An
        object at rest has inertia but no momentum. A moving object has both.

        <h3 class="bold">Change in Momentum</h3>
        When a force acts on an object, its momentum changes. The change in momentum (Δp) is defined as the
        difference between the final momentum and the initial momentum: Δp = psub>final</sub> - psub>initial</sub>  or Δp = mv<sub>f</sub> -
        mv<sub>i</sub>  Δp = m(v<sub>f</sub> - v<sub>i</sub>) Where: v<sub>f</sub> represents the final velocity v<sub>i</sub> represents the initial velocity
        The change in momentum is also a vector quantity. If the direction of the initial and final velocities are
        opposite then you must take the directions into account by making one direction positive and the other negative.
        <h3 class="bold">Newton's Second Law in Terms of Momentum</h3>
        Newton's second law of motion can be expressed in terms of momentum. It states that the net force acting on an
        object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. This can be written as: F<sub>net</sub> = Δp / Δt
        Where: F<sub>net</sub> is the net force acting on the object Δp is the change in momentum Δt is the time interval over
        which the force acts
        <p>
            This equation shows that a larger force will cause a greater change in momentum over a given time, or that
            the same change in momentum can be achieved with a smaller force over a longer time.
