Impulse
Impulse is the product of the net force and the time interval during which the force acts [9, 12]. It is represented by the symbol J [9]. Mathematically:

Impulse (J) = F_net ⋅ Δt [9, 15]

From the relationship between force and momentum change, impulse is also equal to the change in momentum [9, 12]:

J = Δp

Impulse is a vector quantity [9]. It has the same direction as the force. The SI unit for impulse is N⋅s, which is also equal to kg⋅m/s [9].

The Impulse-Momentum Theorem
The impulse-momentum theorem is a combination of the definitions for impulse and change in momentum. It can be expressed mathematically as: F_net . Δt = Δp = mv_f - mv_i [9, 18]

This theorem explains that the impulse acting on an object will cause a change in the object's momentum [9].

Practical Applications of Impulse
Car Safety: Crumple zones in cars increase the time of impact during a collision [19-21]. This increases the time over which the force is exerted, thereby reducing the average force on the occupants, as impulse remains constant [12]. Seat belts also perform a similar function [22].
Airbags: Airbags also increase the time over which a person slows down during a collision thereby reducing the average force on a person [20, 22].
Sports: When catching a ball, a player will move their hands backwards [12]. This increases the contact time and reduces the force needed to stop the ball, reducing the chance of injury [12].
Karate: A karate expert strikes a brick with a fast-moving hand and makes contact with the brick for a short time. The short contact time results in a large force exerted on the brick [12, 22].
Conservation of Linear Momentum
The law of conservation of linear momentum states that the total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant in magnitude and direction if no net external force acts on the system [2, 23-26]. An isolated system is one in which the resultant external force is zero [23, 27, 28]. In simpler terms:

Total momentum before a collision or explosion = Total momentum after the collision or explosion [2, 23].

Mathematically, for a system of two objects:

m_1v_1i + m_2v_2i = m_1v_1f + m_2v_2f [23]

Where:

m_1 and m_2 are the masses of the objects
v_1i and v_2i are their initial velocities
v_1f and v_2f are their final velocities
Collisions
Collisions are interactions between two or more objects where they exert forces on each other for a short period [2, 14]. Momentum is always conserved in collisions, regardless of whether the collision is elastic or inelastic.

Elastic Collisions: In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved [23, 29]. In other words, the total kinetic energy of the system before the collision is equal to the total kinetic energy of the system after the collision [23, 29]. There is no loss of energy as heat or sound [29, 30]. An example of an elastic collision is a collision between billiard balls [30].
Inelastic Collisions: In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not [23, 29]. Some kinetic energy is lost, often converted into other forms of energy such as heat or sound [29, 30]. Most real-world collisions are inelastic to some extent [30]. A collision where objects stick together and move as a unit is an example of a perfectly inelastic collision [23, 29].
Explosions
In an explosion, an object breaks apart into multiple fragments [23]. The total momentum of the system before the explosion is equal to the total momentum of the fragments after the explosion [23, 31]. Often, the initial momentum is zero and so the final momentum is also zero.

Applying Conservation of Momentum
To solve momentum problems, follow these steps:

Identify the system: Define what is included in your isolated system [27, 28].
Draw a diagram: Sketch the scenario, showing the objects and their velocities before and after the collision or explosion [32].
Choose a direction: Define a positive direction [32].
Apply the conservation of momentum: Set up the equation with total initial momentum equal to total final momentum [23].
Substitute values: Fill in all the known values and solve for the unknowns [23].
Key Concepts Revisited
Momentum is the product of mass and velocity [3-5].
Momentum is a vector quantity [3, 6-8].
Change in momentum is the difference between final and initial momentum [13, 14].
Impulse is the product of force and time [9, 12]. It is also the change in momentum [9].
The net force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum [2, 16, 17].
The total momentum of an isolated system remains constant [2, 23-26].
Elastic collisions conserve both momentum and kinetic energy [23, 29].
Inelastic collisions conserve momentum but not kinetic energy [23, 29].
Conclusion
Understanding linear momentum is crucial for grasping the dynamics of motion and interactions in physics [1]. The conservation of momentum is a powerful principle that allows us to analyse and predict the outcomes of collisions and explosions [2, 23]. This concept will be essential for understanding more advanced physics topics.

This chapter provides a good starting point for understanding linear momentum. You should now practice solving numerical problems to become proficient.
